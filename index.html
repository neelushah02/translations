        <p>Kedarnath Singh (1934-2018) was a Hindi poet whose work was marked by simplicity of language and complexity of thought. Never quite fitting in with the modernist Nayi Kavita of Agneya or the experimentalist radicalism of Muktibodh, Singh sits in a class of his own.</p>
        <p>Here I offer translations of ten of Kedarnath’s poems that are close to my heart. I hope this selection brings his romanticism, wit, and focus on the everyday—tinged as always by a deep appreciation of nature—to life.</p>
        <p>These translations are imperfect, as all translations are. But translating Kedarnath Singh is especially difficult. “My house is between the Ganga and the Ghaghara,” he says, drawing attention to the deeply regional, culturally rooted dimension of his writing. Translating these elements—especially to English—is a particularly hairy task. Wherever possible, then, I have tried to adhere to the structure and culture-specific diction of his writing. But essence and emotion take precedence, and I have taken liberties to that end.</p>
