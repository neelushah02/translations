            <p>
                Words do not die from the cold <br>
                They die from a lack of courage <br>
                Often from the dampness of the season <br>
                Words die <br>
                <br>
                Once I found <br>
                A deep red <br>
                Bird-like word <br>
                On the riverbank of the town <br>
                I brought him home <br>
                But just as he reached the threshold <br>
                He looked at me <br>
                With a strange, distressed look <br>
                And breathed his last <br>
                <br>
                Since then I have been scared of words <br>
                Often when I met one I'd cross the street <br>
                Many a time I'd avert my gaze <br>
                When I saw some sparkle-colored <br>
                Plumed word headed in my direction <br>
                <br>
                Then slowly-slowly I began to <br>
                Enjoy this game <br>
                One day for no good reason <br>
                I threw a stone at a handsome word <br>
                When in the stem of some grain <br>
                He lurked like a snake <br>
                His beautiful shining eyes <br>
                I still remember <br>
                <br>
                Now after all these days <br>
                My fear has lessened <br>
                Now when I meet words <br>
                Chit-chat inevitably ensues <br>
                Now I have learned many of their <br>
                Hiding places <br>
                Many of their colors <br>
                I have come to know <br>
                For example I have learned <br>
                That the most simple words are those <br>
                Which are the most black and brown <br>
                The most hazardous ones are the <br>
                Bright yellow and pink <br>
                Which we keep saved <br>
                For our heaviest and saddest times <br>
                Often in those very moments <br>
                They begin to seem obscene <br>
                <br>
                Now what do I make of the fact <br>
                That those which are of no use <br>
                Those discolored <br>
                And castaway words <br>
                In my times of crisis <br>
                I have found them most worthy of trust <br>
                <br>
                This happened just yesterday <br>
                On a dark street <br>
                I was suddenly jumped <br>
                By five or six healthy and beautiful words <br>
                Their faces were covered <br>
                And in their hands was some <br>
                Sharp and heavy-looking thing <br>
                Which glinted menacingly <br>
                Scared out of my wits <br>
                Dripping with sweat <br>
                I stood for some time in front of them <br>
                Speechless <br>
                Then I ran <br>
                I had only just lifted one foot in the air <br>
                When from who knows where some hunchbacked word <br>
                Panted toward me <br>
                And saidâ€”'Come, I'll see you home!' <br>
